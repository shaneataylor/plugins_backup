Communications has licenses for Oxygen, so use of this plugin in the builds should be fine.

The net.webassign.webhelp plugin currently extends the Oxygen webhelp plugin to provide
the customizations we need for WebAssign.

The long-term plan is to remove dependency on the Oxygen webhelp plugin and rebase 
net.webassign.webhelp on the DITA OT XHTML transformation.
